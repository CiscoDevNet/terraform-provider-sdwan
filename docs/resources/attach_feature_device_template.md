# sdwan_attach_feature_device_template (Resource)

This resource can attach a feature device template. Due to limitations of the API, once a device template is attached to a device, only one change can be applied per `terraform apply` operation. More information is available [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/sdwan/latest/docs/guides/updating_templates).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sdwan_attach_feature_device_template" "example" {
  id = sdwan_feature_device_template.DT1.id
  devices = [
    {
      id = "C8K-CC678D1C-8EDF-3966-4F51-ABFAB64F5ABE"
      variables = {
        system_site_id                                  = "1001"
        system_system_ip                                = "1.1.1.1"
