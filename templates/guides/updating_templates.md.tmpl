# Updating Templates and Policies

Similary to the UI workflow, once device templates are attached to a device, updates to templates or policies require the device template to be re-attached to the device.

Each template and policy resource in Terraform exposes a version attribute which can be used to link resources and trigger a re-attachment of the device template if required. Due to brevity the following configuration is not complete and only shows a single feature template being used:

{{tffile "examples/provider/updating_templates.tf"}}

This provider supports updates to a single feature template, device template and policy per device within a single `terraform apply` operation. This is due to vManage locking the templates and policies once a change has been made. If for example two feature templates used in the same device template are being updated, a `terraform apply` operation will show the following warning:

```
│ Warning: Client Warning
│ 
│   with sdwan_cisco_system_feature_template.system,
│   on main.tf line q, in resource "sdwan_cisco_system_feature_template" "system":
│  1: resource "sdwan_cisco_system_feature_template" "system" {
│ 
│ Failed to modify template due to template being locked by another change. Template changes will not be applied. Re-run 'terraform apply' to try again.
```

A subsequent `terraform plan` will show that the feature template has not been updated. Another `terraform apply` will eventually also apply the second updated feature template.
